This is my personal website, mostly intended to be a portfolio for future employers. You can find the code in the /source folder, and the statically generated, which is what is served to people visiting the website website in the /docs folder.

It was made using the portfolio website from mldangelo : https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site
