# Intro

My name is Cyril THOMAS. I am currently pursuing an engineering degree at the Saint-Ã‰tienne National School of Mines, in a curriculum focused on Microelectronics design and Computer sciences. I am very passionate about what I do, and I have worked on many personal projects, some of which you can find online. I am a big believer in open source, which is why you can feel free to browse, use and improve anything I've published.

# Some history

- My first introduction to video games was when we found a PS1 laying on the street, we figured it was worth bringing back home, and it was still perfectly functionnal. One of the first games I got on it was Air Combat, which sparked my love for airplanes.
- My first computer was a [Dell Inspiron 5100](https://www.itechguides.com/product-specs/dell-inspiron-15-5100-specs/), that we bought used in 2010.
- I started participating in the French National Robotics Cup when I entered university. So far I've participated twice with my school's team.
